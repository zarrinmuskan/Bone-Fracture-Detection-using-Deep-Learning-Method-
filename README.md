# Overview
Bone fracture detection is crucial for medical diagnosis and treatment planning. This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to automatically detect fractures in medical images such as X-rays.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of X-ray images of bones with and without fractures.
# Implementation
The fracture detection system is implemented using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The workflow involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.
